# Day 01

After spending almost 2 hours fighting with IntelliJ to just be able to run hello world, I decided to give up and use this template.
So, yes.. to run small code you need download cca 5mb of something to just print number and IDE what does whatever else than what you want,
consume 10gb or ram just because it can. So technically in C and nvim I can spend same amount of time, just everything can be just typed with
no ram and on chip from fucking toaster.
Kotlin it self does not feel so bad...
Anyway still, fuck you JetBrains....
